##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | The project has a simple architecture based on managing a game window and player controls using the Gosu library for game development. It follows a straightforward design for rendering game elements and handling user input. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | The codebase maintains a good level of quality and style, with well-structured classes and methods. It adheres to Ruby coding conventions and demonstrates clear logic flow. However, there may be opportunities for additional documentation and comments. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | The project provides adequate documentation for core components such as the game window, player controls, and visual layer management. However, there is room for improvement in terms of overall documentation coverage, especially for more complex functionalities. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Key integrations include the Gosu library for game development. External dependencies mainly consist of standard Ruby libraries and modules such as 'rb'. These integrations enhance the project's capabilities for building interactive game experiences. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The codebase demonstrates good modularity with separate files for managing different aspects of the game, such as window initialization, player ship control, and visual layer ordering. This modular approach enhances code maintainability and encourages reusability. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | The project may benefit from incorporating testing frameworks such as RSpec or MiniTest to ensure code reliability and functionality. As of now, testing practices are not explicitly outlined within the repository contents. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | The efficiency of the project is reasonable, offering smooth player ship movement and responsive user controls. Resource usage appears to be optimized, providing a satisfactory gaming experience within the defined scope of the Flight Simulator Ruby project. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | The project does not focus extensively on security measures, as it primarily aims to deliver a game development experience. However, standard data protection practices and access control mechanisms can be implemented as needed for enhanced security. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | The project relies on external libraries such as Gosu for graphics and game development functionalities. Core dependencies include 'rb' and 'ruby', contributing to the foundational requirements for running the Flight Simulator Ruby project. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | The project's scalability is moderate, capable of handling a certain level of traffic and user interactions. With additional optimization and performance enhancements, it can be further scaled to accommodate increased game complexity and user engagement. |
